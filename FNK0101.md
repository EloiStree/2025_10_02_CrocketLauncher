> The external power input voltage range is 4-24V. We recommend using a power supply device with at least 12V at 3A to power the Freenove Breakout Board.

>  It is important to note that when both VIN/VCC/5V and 3.3V power options are present on the development board, it is advisable to prioritize the use of VIN/VCC/5V for powering the board.


> During experiments, if the development board is connected to USB for power supply or code downloading, and the Freenove Breakout Board is powered by an external power source, we recommend that you disconnect the positive connection between the development board and the Freenove Breakout Board. This can better protect your development board. As shown in the figure below.

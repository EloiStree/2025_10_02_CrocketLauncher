Better driver alternatives
If efficiency, heat or battery life matters, consider a MOSFET-based H-bridge (much lower on-resistance):
TB6612FNG (good for small motors)
DRV8833 / DRV8871 family (better efficiency)
BTS7960 (for high current)
These give much less voltage drop and lower heat compared to the L298N.
